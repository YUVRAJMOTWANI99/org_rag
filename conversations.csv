user,2024-02-28 22:19:17.850445,what makes glass surface strong?,What factors contribute to the strength of a glass surface?,"Hydrophobicity and surface morphology are the deciding factors for the self-cleaning property of a solid glass surface. Glass substrates with pure phase surfaces associated with hydrophobic sites showed greater wetting ability. Additionally, nano-ceramic coatings have been shown to enhance the strength and self-cleaning properties of glass surfaces."
